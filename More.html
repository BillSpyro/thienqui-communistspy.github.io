        <h2>Biography</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I'm a Vietnamese immigrant who came here when I was one with my Mom and Dad we moved,
          around a lot due to our lack of support so my parents were always going from place
          to place looking for jobs to support our family. I've lived in Sacramento, California,
          Salt Lake City, Utah, Chicago Illinoise and last but not least Lancaster, Pennsylvania
          where I still reside until this day and likely far into the near future. I attended
          Hamilton Elementary school, Wheatland Middle-School, and John Pierstol McCaskey's Highschool
          for my education. For my higher education I went to Thaddeus Steven's college, for Software engineering.

          <h2>Personal Views</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I identify as a Centralist-Atheist, I don't have any particular inclination towards any
          political parties, or ideolologies I often take the side which I view as most pragmatic or has the most practical soliution.
        I was raised a Catholic, and converted to Buddhism during my teenage years, and promptly left when I turned 18.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            </div>
            <p>I have and probably will always be interested in Science, and learning more about the world,
            I enjoy learning about the latest advents in Science and the innovations being developed around the world.
          I'm also an avid fan of history especially Chinese and Indian history, I enjoy reading about the politics,philosophy, and people of the time.
        I also reading about the Philosophy of the people at the time, to see what type of world-view they had in contrast to ours. I'd also like to see
        what we can learn from them, and how their innovations in their daily lives could be used today. One of the biggest interest to me is the possibility of an after-life,
      so I'm always reading about consciousness and the influences of consciousness.</p>
